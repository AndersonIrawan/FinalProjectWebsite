        <img src="8type/1Axial.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">

        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Axial</h3>
            <h4>/ˈaksɪəl/</h4>
            I made a thick diagonal black line and started working from there. I added plenty of white space and fitted in a rectangle to reduce the emptiness.
        </div>

    <div class="hover-box">
        <img src="8type/2Radial.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Radial</h3>
            <h4>/ˈreɪdɪəl/</h4>
            A half circle with text radiating from it with equal spacings. I made it more interesting to look at by adding curved lines around the circle.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/3Dilatational.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">

        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Dilatational</h3>
            <h4>/dʌɪleɪˈteɪʃ(ə)n(ə)l/</h4>
            Perfectly aligned in the middle while it bent around the circles in the centre. I made sure the texts were not too slanted to one side.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/4Random.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Random</h3>
            <h4>/ˈrandəm/</h4>
            I had the text squished and rotated in many directions to fulfil the randomness of the type system. I had a few shapes to bring the randomness even further.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/5Grid.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Grid</h3>
            <h4>/ɡrɪd/</h4>
            I used black boxes as a placeholder for what could be images. The texts were exactly within the height of each box fulfilling the grid layout.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/6Modular.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Modular</h3>
            <h4>/ˈmɒdjʊlə/</h4>
            The texts were within the circles within the rectangle. I made sure to tilt them a little to differentiate it from the Grid type system.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/7Transitional.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Transitional</h3>
            <h4>/tranˈzɪʃ(ə)n(ə)l/</h4>
            I started with wavy shapes as the base of my design. I continued by adding text that followed the flow of the shapes.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="hover-box"> 
    
        <img src="8type/8Bilateral.jpg" class="myDIV" target="blank">
        
        <div class="hide">
            <h3>Bilateral</h3>
            <h4>/bʌɪˈlat(ə)r(ə)l/</h4>
            The texts were justified to fit the middle section, except the title and subtitle. I added simple triangular shapes to fill in the white space.
        </div>
