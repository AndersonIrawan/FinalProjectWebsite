            Making the True/False poster, I had three takes on how I wanted to incorporate the objects. I went for a radial, bilateral, and eventually choosing the axial â€“ bilateral mix which fitted cleverly with the logo at hand. My plan from the start was to incorporate as much of the given vectors instead of giving my own. I chose the colors from the logo and added in similar ones for contrast. I added an arrow-like background to make my poster look dynamic as well as add borders to make it all seem neat and contained. The Brookline typeface had a geometrical shape with some slanted variations for the text, which made it more uniform with the side slash (/) of the title. I chose the Ernestine Pro font family for its serif modern look and readability. Lastly, I added icons of a clapper board and theatre masks so that people would know this is a film festival from a glance.
