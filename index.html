                <h3 id="report">Report</h3>

                <p class="report">Before starting the Graphic and Web Design module of the course, I knew this was going to be that module I would enjoy the most. Coming from a year of pandemic, I have been into graphic design and the need to heighten my knowledge and skill grew the moment I was bound to step into university. Starting off, I was sure I had some knowledge of basic design principals such as typography, color, and white space, but never have I had done work that was focused on a specific part of design, e.g., the type system task. 
                    <br><br>
                    When the first task, CARP poster, was unveiled, I knew this would not be much trouble until I realized that the person looking at my poster would be someone who knew design much more than I do instead of my past clients, also known as my friends, who only pointed out the obvious problems. I also have never touched InDesign before this. My goal was to first get what I know about design out on the table and serve it up to Mary borrowing some tropes from the things she already discussed in class the weeks after the announcement. After doing all three posters, I came to the conclusion I would merge all three ideas into one strong poster design. In the end, I was pretty satisfied.
                    <br><br>   
                    Following the CARP posters were the coding tasks. I had some knowledge of HTML and CSS, but I have never gotten to design a website all for myself with it, and it was really refreshing to do so. The coding tasks were very informative and an enjoyable way of learning. There was also the typography task which I found to be the most interesting. Learning about the 8 different typographic systems helped me organize my thought process when designing typography.
                    <br><br>  
                    Lastly was the UX task where I sketched out the flowchart and wireframes for my website. I had some ambitious ideas for my website, some of which I was not sure I could pull off. Truth be told, some ideas did not come through, but this taught me to improvise and learn that sometimes design does not need to look magnificent to serve a great purpose. Before this, I used to be more doubtful of my work when it does not come out as I wanted it to despite it always getting some form of praise from others. Now, I have learned to not be so harsh on myself when it comes to my capabilities and results.

                Hi! I’m Anderson, often going by Andy. I am 18 as of making this website. I come from the tropical nation of Indonesia where it is either hot or rainy or both! My hobbies range from logo design, superhero movies/shows, cooking, and video games. I am the oldest of four so I am the one to pave the way to study abroad. There’s probably another interesting thing about me but can’t think of any more at the moment.
